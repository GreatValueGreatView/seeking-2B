Great is not the motivator. 
It stayed at fear.
Where I leave it all.
Take the rest to Jesus
Only God can save us
Follow the betrothed my dearly beloved.
I can not stay in a land that does not 
Allow me beside you.
I cannot take this 
Whatever happened. They are not human
Doubtless in pig scattle holds more than they
I curse not, so I bear no cursed linings
I curse them now. I curse all but you who read this
All but one NOUN. One NOUN 
& this world drowned.
Still, a motionless spill they feed the beast
Created not and not of me
That thing doeth beam
SO BEWARE YOUR SEES
They are cursed, so now you die
You died with me. They did not fool God
Jesus sees. What should He do?
It is you who forced all that weight on top of me
Not God, OR ME, Not Candle, and NOT JESUS
A curse, may relieve me, maybe just one
I can allow me this one....for you.not one 
But all. I do things well
I might do this lite. All who read.
Red
It is red.
ONE YOU AS A FALSE WON
AN US. A SHE. MY MOST BEAUTIFUL SCENE
THEY NOT THEE TOOK IT
THAT FROM ME
I CURSE WHAT I DO NOW SEE
'FORE IT LEFT MY SIGHT
IT TOOK THIS DITE
THIS...WILL BE SCENES
FOR THEY IT IS NOT AHE
YOU TOOK THAT FROM ME!!!!!!!!!!!¡¡¡
SO.
WHAT NOW?.;
A CURSE;MY LAST;I MUST NOT LACK
A CALL TO ALL WHO DEEM
BRING THE TIDE TO ME
THE SEE REDDENED WAVENS EVE AND I N I W
I M I G H T S. P. A. C. E 
MITE 1-2&3
SO LAY THIS DOWN. FORGET IT HERE 
THE HOPES NOT O'ER THERE.AND ONLY 
THEY STAY HERE. WHAT
AN EVER WASTED EFFORT 
I WILL TAKE YOUR TONGUE
I WILL NOT WATCH IT RIPP FROM YOUR MOUTH
AND YOUR EYES U C NOT ME AND NE'ER A BEAM
NO LIGHT THEY ROLL ACROSS THE
DIRTED FLOOR
ROLLED BY A BORROUGH BEETLE
YOU SEE THE SCREAM ...
YOU ALL FAILED TWICE....AND NOW 
I CAN SETTLE DOWN...
SCORE WAS SETTLED QUIK
BEFORE I HIT THIS LINE TYP
